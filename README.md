# Predictive-Analytics
The study would aim to use multiple regression analysis to identify 
whether there is a significant correlation between the quality of feedback provided to students and their level of motivation.

The study collected data on various factors that may have an impact on the relationship between feedback and motivation.
These factors include
• Demographic Information : email, age, gender, and program of study
• Characteristics of the Feedback : focus, level of detail, tone, and timing.
• Feedback’s Impact on Student Motivation: Confidence, Satisfaction, Enthusiasm, and Perceived Helpfulness to predict Students’ motivation level

The study's participants comprise students from a diverse range of universities and programs of study, 
who completed the questionnaire, thereby contributing to the data collection process

The link to the questionnaire utilized to gather data on feedback and motivation, and to examine their 
relationship, has been included below for reference.
